This is a Java Project made for 2nd Year Data Structure & Algorithms 2.
It features a map of the UBhan in Vienna.

The application allows the user to select two stations on the map and the application will draw a line connecting the two stations.
It applies Dijkstra's algorithm to allows routing for the shortest/ and can exlude selected stations, allowing for re-routing.
